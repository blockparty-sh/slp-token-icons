## Adding your icon

If have the file in SVG format, call it whatever and slap it into the `svg` directory. A `convert-icons.sh` script is provided to generate raster icons for you easily.

Alternatively, create a version of your icon in 32x32 / 64x64 / 128x128 pixels, add to their respective folders and create a pull request.

Add the original un-resized file to original if you have one.

You may also open an issue with links to an icon in at least 128x128 and I'll resize them for you.
